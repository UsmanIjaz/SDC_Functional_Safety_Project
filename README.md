## Functional Safety Project: Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System
In this project, we’ll construct part of a safety case for a lane departure warning feature. We’ll begin with the hazard 
analysis and risk assessment, and create further documentation for functional and technical safety concepts, and 
finally software and hardware requirements. Analyzing and documenting system safety is critical for autonomous vehicle 
development. These are skills that often only experienced automotive engineers possess!

### Project Overview
In this project, we are going to create a report that documents the functional safety of a lane assistance system. 
Project includes:

- a [Safety Plan](https://github.com/UsmanIjaz/SDC_Functional_Safety_Project/blob/master/01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance_Template.docx.pdf)
- a [Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment](https://github.com/UsmanIjaz/SDC_Functional_Safety_Project/blob/master/02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment_Template.xlsx%20-%20Hazard%20Analysis%20and%20Risk%20Assess.pdf)
- a [Functional Safety Concept](https://github.com/UsmanIjaz/SDC_Functional_Safety_Project/blob/master/03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance_Template.docx.pdf)
- a [Technical Safety Concept](https://github.com/UsmanIjaz/SDC_Functional_Safety_Project/blob/master/04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance_Template.docx.pdf)
- [Software Requirements](05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance_Template.pdf)
